The issue is that there are TWO return statements in the component:

1. Line 847: ends ConversationsList function with )
2. Line 849: starts main component return

This is causing the syntax error. The ConversationsList is properly defined as an arrow function with parentheses, but the main component return should be the only return statement.

Solution: Remove the first ) on line 847 and keep only the main return statement.
